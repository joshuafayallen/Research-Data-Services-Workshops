# What is tidy data?

- Every variable is a column

- Every row is an observation

- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

- Most of the time this looks like what is known as "long data"

# Pros of the Tidyverse

One of the most furious debates in R is base R versus tidyverse. I will not go into great detail about them because many people who are better at R than me have 

- Similar syntax and philosophy which makes it more intuitive to learn

- Extremely nice community

- The core syntax of `dplyr` provides a nice front end for many other big data tools i.e. SQL

- Generally pretty intuitive and easy to figure out what past you has done.
--
However,

do not avoid some base R solutions 

Base R is more stable so it limits the fragility of your code 

A mix of base R and the tidyverse never hurt nobody

---

---
class:center, middle 
```{r echo = FALSE}
tidyverse::tidyverse_packages()
```

???
These are the packages that are considered a part of the tidyerse. The ones that are loaded when you do library tidyverse are ggplot tibble tidyr readr purr dplyr stringr and forcats. Magrittr is also loaded. But if you want anything else like rvest and broom 

---

---
# What is loaded

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
- However you can load in specific packages. There is something called the tinyverse that loads in `ggplot2` and `data.table`

???
The tidyverse is pretty verbose because it loads a lot of things and in the case of lag and filter actually makes its lag and filter function the one that R uses. 

---

---



---
# Namespace Conflicts


- Since R is open source you can name your functions just about anything
  - this results in lots of packages having similarly named functions 
  
- `Dplyr` is just warning us that if we use `filter` or `lag` it will use `dplyr`'s version of the function

- Whenever `R` runs into a namespace conflict it will default to the last package that was loaded

- It is generally best practice to load the `tidyverse` last

- You can also use `packagename::function you want to use` to get around it. 
  - This is called a namespace call
  - explicitly tells R which function you are using

# A Common Syntax

```{r echo=FALSE}
decorate('
VERB(DATA, ...)
', eval = FALSE) |> 
  flair("VERB", background = "#EFB3FF", before = "<b>", after = "</b>") |> 
  flair("DATA", background = "#FFDFD1", before = "<b>", after = "</b>") |>  
  flair("...", background = "#FFD0CF", before = "<b>", after = "</b>") |> 
  knit_print.with_flair() 

```

.pull-right[


- <b><span style="background: #EFB3FF">`VERB`</span></b> = dplyr function/verb
- <b><span style="background: #FFDFD1">`DATA`</span></b> = Data frame to transform
- <b><span style="background: #FFD0CF">`...`</span></b> = Stuff the verb does

]
???
In the intro I mentioned that the tidyverse is great because we have a common way of working with data regardless of the thing we want to do with our data. We determine what verb we want to use. We tell it what data it is working with and what you want to do with it.

# Piping 

- The pipe is wildly convenient and makes your code much easier to debug

- It is a lot more intuitive than huge nested calls not only to read but to write 

- It is how most people do things in the tidyverse 

???
Rather than starting with nested parenthesis we will start with piping. because it affords us a ton of advantages

---

---
# Magrittr Piping

The tidyverse has its own pipe `%>%` and used to be the only game in town.
  - `%>%` is just `%` followed by `>` followed by `%>%`
  
- A pipe takes whats on the left hand side of the pipe and evaluates it as the *first* argument on the right hand side 


```{r eval = FALSE}
# These do the same thing
summarise(group_by(filter(penguins,species == "Adelie"), island), mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

penguins %>%  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% group_by(island) %>% summarise(mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

.footnote[Example provided by [Grant McDermot](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures)]
---

---
# Magrittr Piping(cont)

- When you pipe stuff it is easier to think of the pipe as saying and then

- If we use an example from your morning routine we can start to figure it our 

```
me %>%
wake_up(time = "8.00am") %>%
get_out_of_bed(side = "correct") %>%
get_dressed(pants = "TRUE", shirt = "TRUE") %>% 
leave_house(car = TRUE, bike = FALSE, MARTA = FALSE) %>%
am_late(traffic = TRUE)

```

# Base R Pipe

- The pipe caught on and the team behind `R` added a native pipe |>
  - this is just `|` followed by `>`

- If you are have a version of R that is older than `4.2.0` it should come with the native pipe

- The base versus magrittr pipe differ slightly and it is worth knowing some of the differences

- The base R pipe is pretty flexible and supports some cool computer sciency stuff for more [check out this page](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/pipeOp.html)
  - I tend to use the base R pipe
