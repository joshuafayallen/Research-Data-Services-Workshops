Lets take a quick look at the data that I have loaded in. They look pretty similar for the most part and aren't correlated

# The Dino Strikes


```{r dino-plot, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(df,!dataset %in% c("bullseye", "dots", "v_lines", "high_lines", "wide_lines", "h_lines", "away")), aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_allen_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(vars(dataset))
```
???
I filtered out some of the data sets just for display purposes but critically if we don't plot our data we may miss patterns that are not recognizable to us when we are taking descriptive statistics. They are also great tools for model diagnostics. A quick  look at our residuals and fitted values is a great indicator whether something is up we use distance plots to look at whether our results are being driven by outliers

# Why `ggplot2`?

<center>

<gsu-blockquote-red>

The transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualization, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive. `r tufte::quote_footer("- Hadley Wickham")`

# Why `ggplot2`?

- You have probably heard of it but why use it?

--

- Once we understand the "grammar" making figures becomes a lot easier
  - Conveying information becomes easier
  - Lets you show off your clean, or not so clean, data
  - A coherent structure of doing things

--

- Flexibility
  - Tons ways to customize appearance
  - Lots of functions

--

- Makes you lazier
  - Doesn't require you to remember each input from a drop down menu
  - Defaults to universally usable formats
  - Replaces itself automatically in your directory 

???
ggplot2 is probably one of the most well known and event among many of the staunchest base r users well loved an well used libraries in the R ecosystem.

ggplot2 predates most of the tidyverse and the gg part refers to the grammar of graphics, more on that later. Much like writing a sentence there is a proper grammar to it. Once we understand the rules we can construct lots of different "sentences".

I think an important theme so to say is that once we start to understand R it benefits your workflow because we can simply tweak a few things and then BAM it will just update. If you are a Latex user then bam the same plot just updates. If you are a word user then those benefits are limited but ggplots play nicely with Word. No having to put replace everywhere or screenshot things.

As with many things in R there are a ton of ways to install ggplot2. If you did not attend the intro to the tidyverse session. The tidyverse is a wrapper term for a ton of packages with very similar logics.

# What does this mean in practice? 

- .vero-red[Data] you are going to visualize

- .vero-red[Geom]etric objects that appear on your plot

- .vero-red[Aes]ethic mappings from data to visual component

- .vero-red[Stat]istics transform data on the way to visualization

- .vero-red[Coord]inates organize location of the geometric objects

- .vero-red[Scale]s define the range of the values for aesthics

- .vero-red[Facet]s groups into subplots

Once we see the structure we can start to be able to build our "sentences" to make our plots In a second we will see how to work with stuff and how to start doing things.

  guides(size = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE, title = "Continent"), color =      guide_legend(title = "Population"))

ggplot will take the color argument inside aes and outside aes. If we specify color inside aes than it will color things by a column in the dataset. If you specify color outside of aes ggplot will make everything that color

Remember when we do things in aes R will look for a column in our dataset. Importantly R will just looks for things it can do given the scope of the function. So if we put blue into the aes portion of it will plot it. But it will get confused because blue is not a column in our data set.

It's not that certain geoms should never be used with certain kinds its that sometimes it doesnt make a whole lot of sense or we aren't getting the most out of our data visualizations. If it takes the arguments it will plot it.

So we have mostly been working inside the individual geoms. However most people do not do this because it can start to get inconvenient quickly. If we work inside each individual geom than the other geom will not know what is going on and ggplot will get confused. 

Instead if you pass off our argument to the first layer

In some cases you may want to change the coordinates of the plot to expand or contract the coordinates or in some cases just flip them without hassle. ggplot defaults to using coord_cartesian on its own but coord_cartesian can be used to zoom in on part of the plot. The coor_flip here is a bit silly but it is insanely useful for barcharts and other charts where you may have added things into aes and don't want to go back and redo it

theme change the default look of the plot and really start to make ggplots look great. The writter of ggplot set the default to theme grey. And tweets out frequently in defense of the default theme. However by in large most people tend to hate the default theme and use one of the other theme or a modified theme.

For now just ignore theme_update, theme_replace, theme_get, and theme test. If you are curious just look at the help documentation. In this presentation I have used, outside of theme_gray, theme_bw, and theme_void but there are so many more
